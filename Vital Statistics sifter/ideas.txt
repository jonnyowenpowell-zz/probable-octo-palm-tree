Ideas For GUI program/Process

Read original .json file
Create original_RepeatsRemoved.json file (like the original process

Use this file to search for specific words,... (like the original process ,however it clasifies things based on a boolean system, of interest or not of interest)
Does this be searching for a series of key words

	Perhaps can provide suggestions for words

Display a breakdown of vital statistics:
-a pie chart showing what the main issues are
-a histogram showing the volitility of a produect
(can maybe swich between using cases, units or events as a metric)

able to enter a price per product
-a slider can be used to calculate the initial loss of income from the recall
-displays warning about this is not the only cost

-perhaps can bring up details about the worst few recalls within the industry, specific to tht productso that this can be considered when writing a contract,.. what to cover and what to not cover

can perhaps show a calculation for how much the initial cost is, as well as the 10 times this for the 'real' recall cost
